# tetris-game

I was practising Java Swing and consolidting all the fundamental controls when I worked on it.

Tetrads are generated randomly.
Move automatically along the y-axix.
Two buttons move the along the x-axis.

A few things are still not implemented.

My next challenges would be:
1) Rotation of tetrads
2) Tetrads alignment once they land
3) Full line disapearance.
